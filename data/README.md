## `ffdi-firegions-thenandnow.csv`

A further processed version of `ffdi-firegions.csv` designed to compare an earlier period (July 1969 to June 1995) to a newer one (July 1995 to June 2020).

Columns include:

- `LGA_CODE23`: Local Government Area code from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
- `LGA_NAME23`: Local Government Area name from the ABS.
- `STE_NAME21`: State name from the ABS
- `slug`: A URL slug identifier based on the LGA name
- `cent_lat`: The latitude of the LGA centroid (based on largest polygon)
- `cent_lon`: The longitude of the LGA centroid (based on largest polygon)
- `month`: The month
- `n_1970_1995`: The number of high fire danger days for this LGA and month across July 1969 to June 1995
- `n_1995_2020`: The number of high fire danger days for this LGA and month across July 1995 to June 2020

# Requisite data not provided

## `copernicus-firedanger/australia`

Gridded NetCDF (`.nc`) files from [Fire danger indices historical data from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cems-fire-historical-v1?tab=form), based on the ERA5 dataset. These are required by `/analysis/ffdi` but not generated.

These can be downloaded manually from the above link or downloaded automatically using Copernicus's API. The files don't need to have any particular date order; they are combined temporally as part of the analysis. They can be approximately cropped to Australia beforehand (this may speed up processing compared to feeding full global files in).

## `ffdi-firegions.csv`

A semi-processed version of `ffdi-firegions-thenandnow.csv` (not version controlled due to size: about 1.1 GB uncompressed) but generated by `/analysis/1-tidy/ffdi`. Contains daily FFDI field-averaged across each council area. May be useful to reconstruct if you would like more recent FFDI data, as the source dataset tracks new observations.

Columns include:

- `LGA_CODE23`: Local Government Area code from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
- `slug`: A URL slug identifier based on the LGA name
- `LGA_NAME23`: Local Government Area name from the ABS.
- `STE_NAME21`: State name from the ABS
- `cent_lat`: The latitude of the LGA centroid (based on largest polygon)
- `cent_lon`: The longitude of the LGA centroid (based on largest polygon)
- `value`: The FFDI value for the day
- `dt`: The date
